# Phase 3: AI Execution Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 focused on implementing AI components, including data preprocessing, model training, and utility functions. Unit and integration tests were created and successfully executed to validate the functionality of these components.

## Key Deliverables
### Codebase
- **Data Processing**:
  - `preprocess.py`: Script for preprocessing raw data.
- **Models**:
  - `sample_model.py`: Simple linear regression model.
  - `model_training.py`: Script for training the AI model.
- **Utilities**:
  - `helpers.py`: Utility functions for logging and accuracy calculation.

### Tests
- **Unit Tests**:
  - `test_data_processing.py`: Validated the data preprocessing script.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - `test_model_integration.py`: Tested the integration of data preprocessing and model training.

## Key Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Ensured all components are modular and reusable.
- **Testing**: Prioritized testing to validate functionality and integration.

## Next Steps
1. Optimize AI components for performance and scalability.
2. Update `MASTER_GOAL_PROGRESS.md` to reflect Phase 3 completion.
3. Transition to Phase 4: Testing and Iteration.

## Lessons Learned
- Early testing ensures robust and reliable components.
- Modular design simplifies integration and future enhancements.
