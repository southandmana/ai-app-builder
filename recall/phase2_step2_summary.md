# Phase 2: Development Planning Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 focused on creating detailed development plans for the app's core screens: `home_screen`, `login_screen`, and `profile_screen`. Deliverables included user flows, data flows, state flows, API/service flows, error/exception flows, and security/privacy flows for each screen.

## Key Deliverables
### Home Screen
- **User Flow**: Defined the sequence of user interactions.
- **Data Flow**: Outlined data exchanges between the app and server.
- **State Flow**: Documented app states during user interactions.
- **API/Service Flow**: Specified API endpoints and their functions.
- **Error/Exception Flow**: Addressed potential errors and their handling.
- **Security/Privacy Flow**: Ensured secure data handling and user privacy.

### Login Screen
- **User Flow**: Detailed the login process.
- **Data Flow**: Mapped data exchanges for authentication.
- **State Flow**: Captured app states during login.
- **API/Service Flow**: Listed authentication-related API endpoints.
- **Error/Exception Flow**: Planned for error scenarios like invalid credentials.
- **Security/Privacy Flow**: Focused on secure credential handling and session management.

### Profile Screen
- **User Flow**: Illustrated the process of viewing and editing profile information.
- **Data Flow**: Tracked data exchanges for profile management.
- **State Flow**: Defined app states during profile interactions.
- **API/Service Flow**: Described endpoints for fetching and updating profile data.
- **Error/Exception Flow**: Prepared for errors like validation failures.

## Key Decisions
- **Consistency**: Ensured uniform structure and naming conventions across all deliverables.
- **Security**: Prioritized secure data handling and user privacy in all flows.
- **Error Handling**: Addressed potential errors comprehensively to enhance user experience.

## Next Steps
1. Validate all deliverables for completeness and accuracy.
2. Update `MASTER_GOAL_PROGRESS.md` to reflect Phase 2 completion.
3. Transition to Phase 3: AI Execution, focusing on implementing AI components and initial tests.

## Lessons Learned
- A structured, phase-based approach ensures clarity and thoroughness.
- Early focus on security and error handling minimizes risks in later phases.
