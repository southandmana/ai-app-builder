# Data Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the flow of data within the AI app builder, from user input to app deployment.

## Data Flow Steps
1. **User Input**:
   - Users provide input through the dashboard, specifying app features and configurations.
   - Input data is validated and stored in the database.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The app builder processes user input to generate an app concept.
   - AI models analyze the input to suggest additional features and optimizations.

3. **Feature Integration**:
   - Selected features are integrated into the app architecture.
   - Data flows between modules (e.g., authentication, messaging) are defined.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test data is generated to validate app functionality.
   - Results are stored and displayed on the dashboard.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deployment configurations (e.g., regions, scaling) are prepared.
   - Data is packaged and deployed to the cloud infrastructure.

## Data Security
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
- Sensitive data is anonymized before processing.
- Access to data is restricted based on user roles.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time data flow visualization.
- Add support for data export and reporting.
