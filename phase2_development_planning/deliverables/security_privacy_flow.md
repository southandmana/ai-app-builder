# Security and Privacy Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the security and privacy measures implemented in the AI app builder to ensure user data protection and compliance with regulations.

## Security Measures
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - All sensitive data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3.
   - Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - OAuth2 is used for secure user authentication.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users have appropriate permissions.

3. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Regular security scans are conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Dependencies are monitored for known vulnerabilities.

## Privacy Measures
1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Only essential user data is collected.
   - Data retention policies ensure data is not stored longer than necessary.

2. **Compliance**:
   - The app builder complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.
   - A clear privacy policy is provided to users.

3. **User Control**:
   - Users can access, modify, and delete their data.
   - Consent is obtained before collecting personal data.

## Workflow Integration
- Security and privacy checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Automated tests validate compliance with security and privacy standards.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement zero-trust architecture.
- Add support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
